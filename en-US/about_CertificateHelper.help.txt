# Certificate Helper

This module will help you manage user certificates.

A certificate is an ID that identifies all the information that a certificate contains.
All this information will be stored on a JSON file.
At the same time a PDF will be generated to be sent to the user.

This way you can generate the PDF based on the JSON file.
Storing the JSON files we have a database of all the certificates issued for later analysis.


## Generate a certificate 

Create a HashTable with all the information of the training or achievement to certify.
Call New-CertificateV1 with the student company and student handle as parameters.
A call to GitHub will be made to retrieve the user Name. 
This is a sanity check to confirm that the user exists.

```powershell

    $param = @{
        StampName = "solidify_training_v1"
        PdfTemplate = certificateTemplate.pdf

        TrainerHandle = "smartGuy"
        TrainerName = "Joe Smart"
        TrainerCompany = "trainerCompany"
        CourseName = "The Name of the course attended"
        CourseDate = "February 29th, 2033"
    }
        
    # Generate certificate
    New-CertificateV1 -StudentHandle "$studentHandle" -StudentCompany "studentCompany" @param
```

You can pipe user names to New-CertificateV1 to generate several certificates of the same course for differnt users.

```powershell
    $param = @{
        StampName = "solidify_training_v1"
        PdfTemplate = certificateTemplate.pdf

        TrainerHandle = "smartGuy"
        TrainerName = "Joe Smart"
        TrainerCompany = "trainerCompany"
        CourseName = "The Name of the course attended"
        CourseDate = "February 29th, 2033"
    }
        
    # Generate certificate from a list of students
    (user1,user2,user3) | New-CertificateV1 -StudentCompany "studentCompany" @param

    # Generate certificate from a file with a list of students
    Get-Content .\students.txt | New-CertificateV1 -StudentCompany "studentCompany" @param

    # Generate certificate from the output of a different command as Get-ClassUsers from the 
    # module rulasg/GitHubDevelopersTrainingTeacherScripts
    Get-ClassUsers -RepoName gh-For-Dev-23120 | New-CertificateV1 -StudentCompany "studentCompany" @param
